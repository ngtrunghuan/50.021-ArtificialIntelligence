Use the command line (untested due to my problem with installing matplotlib on Mac virtualenv):
> # For part 1
> python ai_hw01.py -p 1
> # For part 2 (-n to add noise to y)
> python ai_hw01.py -p 2
> python ai_hw01.py -p 2 -n

Or run directly on IDE (comment out the __main__ code and de-comment the function call for each part)
